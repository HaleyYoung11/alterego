Build for my final art project in the fall of 2016.

For this project I want to imagine who I might have been if I pursued my original childhood dream of being an author. To this day I am immensely passionate about writing and have been unable to fully abandon my thoughts of publishing a novel, so I’d like to explore that possibility through this character. She will be very similar to me in name, age, gender and sexual orientation, etc. but will have a creative writing portfolio/author biography website as opposed to the current web development portfolio I have now. She will write about the things I always dreamed of (things I often still do think about): the interconnectivity of the world, the intensity of love, the importance of relationships, the subjectivity of experience. Perhaps she has published a dystopian novel like the ones I read in my favorite 7th grade English unit. Perhaps she followed through on the worn out list of “novel ideas” that still sits in the drawer of my childhood bedside table. Perhaps she did all of these things and more - or perhaps she still will.

For the design, I will incorporate my less refined and more intuitive tastes from the days that fiction writing seemed like my destined career; when I dreamt of being an author I always loved the font Georgia and will definitely be including that in my work, along with the gray/blue color scheme with which I was once so enamored. 


Pages/Organizational Structure

Home Page:
Short introduction, mainly featuring images and a large header, with quick links to my most popular published works.

About:
A general biography coupled with the story of how I got into writing (I will utilize the true story I often cite, about my first novel in the 4th grade)

Work:

Cyber: the novel that I wrote in the 4th grade. In this version of my life I like to think that I actually published it. Cyber is about a lost dog trying to find his way home to his loving owner, and all of the fabulously terrible adventures he experiences along the way.

Willow Street: a novel I started but never finished, built on a dystopian theme. In an oppressive society, street names dictate who can live on the roads, what their houses can look like, etc. In the real world I was never fully able to develop the idea, but it stemmed from the interesting thoughts I had when I was younger (as a small child, for example, I truly believed that only people named Harrison could live on Harrison Street).

My World In Lists: another novel for which I drafted ideas but never brought to fruition. My World In Lists was to be about the life of an extremely obsessive compulsive individual who constantly made lists, and it was going to tell this story entirely through these lists with no supplemental paragraphs or dialogue.
